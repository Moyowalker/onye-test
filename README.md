# AI on FHIR Query System with OAuth 2.0 + SMART on FHIR

Hello Emmanuel,

This is my take on building a natural language interface for FHIR healthcare data with secure authentication. The goal was to let people query patient records and medical conditions without writing complex database queries ‚Äî just using plain English, while maintaining proper healthcare security standards.

## üîí New: Authentication & Authorization

I've implemented **OAuth 2.0 with SMART on FHIR** authentication for enterprise-grade security:

- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Secure authentication using Auth0 as identity provider
- **SMART on FHIR Scopes**: Healthcare-specific permissions (`patient/*.read`, `user/*.read`)
- **JWT Validation**: Backend validates tokens with Auth0 JWKS for security
- **Role-Based Access**: Users see only data they're authorized to access
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with NextAuth.js

### Authentication Features
- üîê Login/logout with Auth0
- üë§ User profile display with permissions
- üéØ Scope-based data filtering (patients only see their authorized data)
- üîë JWT bearer token authentication for API calls
- üö´ Protected routes and endpoints
- ‚ö° Automatic token refresh

See [AUTH0_SETUP.md](./AUTH0_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

## What It Does

Type something like "show me patients with diabetes" and the system:
1. Processes your query using NLP (spaCy)
2. Figures out what you're looking for
3. Filters the FHIR data accordingly
4. Shows you results with charts and visualizations

I deployed the frontend to Vercel and Dockerized everything so you can spin it up locally in seconds.

## Quick Setup

### Option 1: With Authentication (Full Experience)

1. **Set up Auth0** (see [AUTH0_SETUP.md](./AUTH0_SETUP.md) for detailed guide):
   - Create Auth0 account and application
   - Configure SMART on FHIR scopes
   - Set up API with JWT validation

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment templates
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/src/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
   
   # Fill in your Auth0 values in both .env files
   ```

3. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moyowalker/onye-test.git
   cd onye-test
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Option 2: Quick Demo (No Auth Setup)

For a quick demo without authentication setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moyowalker/onye-test.git
cd onye-test
# Comment out authentication middleware in backend/main.py
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Points:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

See [docker_guide.md](./docker_guide.md) for more detailed Docker instructions.

### Local Development:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI + spaCy for NLP + Python 3.11
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + SMART on FHIR via Auth0
- **Security**: JWT validation + scope-based authorization
- **Deployment**: Docker + Vercel
- **Data**: FHIR R4 compliant mock resources

## Try These Queries

- "Show me all patients"
- "Find patients with diabetes" 
- "Show patients older than 50"
- "List all conditions"

## What I Focused On

**Core Functionality**: Got the NLP processing working smoothly with spaCy. The query parser can handle different phrasings and extract entities like age, conditions, and gender filters.

**FHIR Standards**: Made sure the data follows FHIR R4 resource structure. In a real scenario, this would connect to an actual FHIR server, but for now I'm using mock data that matches the spec.

**DevOps**: Dockerized both services with proper health checks, non-root users, and multi-stage builds. Everything orchestrates through docker-compose with a custom network.

**UI/UX**: Kept it clean and functional. Added visualizations (charts for age distribution, gender breakdown, condition stats) using Recharts. Went with an emerald/teal theme instead of the typical blue.

## What I'd Improve With More Time

1. **Real FHIR Integration**: Hook this up to an actual FHIR server (HAPI FHIR or Azure FHIR service) instead of mock data

2. **Enhanced SMART Authorization**: Implement patient selection workflow and launch context for full EHR integration

3. **Better NLP**: The current parser works but could be smarter. Would love to add support for complex queries like "male patients over 60 with diabetes OR hypertension"

4. **Advanced Auth Features**: Add user management, admin roles, API key authentication for service-to-service calls

5. **Testing**: Need unit tests for the NLP parser, authentication middleware, and integration tests for the API endpoints

6. **Caching**: Redis layer for frequently accessed FHIR resources and JWT validation caching

7. **Error Handling**: More graceful error messages and retry logic for Auth0 failures

8. **Observability**: Proper logging (structured JSON logs) and maybe OpenTelemetry for tracing

9. **Performance**: Database integration with proper indexing for large FHIR datasets

## Notes

- The backend runs on port 8000, frontend on 3000
- CORS is configured for localhost:3000
- Check out [docker_guide.md](./docker_guide.md) for deployment details
- HIPAA considerations are documented in the [PDF compliance plan](./HIPAA_Compliance_and_Security_Plan_by_Moyo.pdf)

Thanks for reviewing my submission.

I really enjoyed building this ‚Äî especially the challenge of bridging NLP and FHIR in a way that feels natural and useful.
